# Mapping whole-organism genetic comorbidities across model organisms using unified ontologies

## CoMoDB
This repository contains code and files for our article in preparation in GENETICS (Peaslee et al, 2026).

CoMo DBM is an RStudio analysis pipeline that uses an input gene list to collect and tally phenotypes per biological system across five organisms (human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, and roundworm) from the [MARRVEL API](https://marrvel.org/doc).

## Analysis Instructions

### Setup Input Files
CoMo DBM requires 1) gene list in txt file format (one gene per line) 2) phenotype ontology terms for each species (column 1 contains phenotype ID's and column 2 contains phenotype term names) 3) R code "MARRVEL_COMO_DB.R"


```
Required Packages:

install.packages("httr")
library("httr")
install.packages('jsonlite', repos = c('https://jeroen.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
library("jsonlite")
install.packages("gprofiler2")
library("gprofiler2")

Required files: 
├── mouse_mgi.txt                     # List of mouse NOA genes
├── fertility_categories/            # Folder containing phenotype ontology terms used in "reproduction" MCat
│   ├── human_terms.txt              
│   ├── mouse_terms.txt
│   ├── zebrafish_terms.txt
│   ├── fly_terms.txt
│   └── worm_terms.txt
├── MARRVEL_COMO_DB.R                # R script(s) for preprocessing and analysis

# Optional reference file:
├── fertility_cats_big_table_formatted_june2024.txt
│                                     # Big table of reproduction phenotype ontology terms organized by species.
```

### Run Pipeline

MARRVEL_COMO_DB.R should be opened with R Studio, and input files should be loaded into the environment with the code file.

Output file "big.out" is used for downstream analysis of phenotypes per gene, per species.
